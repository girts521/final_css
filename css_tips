$font-weights: ( "regular" : 400, "medium": 500);  font-weight: map-get($font-weights, bold);
@function weight($weight-name) { @return map-get($font-weights, $weight-name);}
To use mixin: @include mixinname;
@mixin flexcenter {display:flex,}
mixins can take arguments like func
creating light and dark theme!!
===========================
@mixin theme($light-theme: true) {
@if $light-theme{
background: lighten($primary-color, 100%);
color: darken(text-color, 100%);
}
}
This is used with primary text color as white and background as black
you also need to create a light class
.light {
@include theme($light-theme: true); }
=========================
yoou can @extend, this will add all the same styles of a specific class to another class and then you can add your changes
.class1{ background: blue;}
.class2{ @extend class1; color: white;}
the class2 will have both the background color and the text color!!
